                    <p>  I love to use my candles while I game or do work. Usually I will leave a candle on my desk next to me lit for anywhere between 1-2 hours. It helps relax the mood in the room as well as keep my hands warm. </p>

                      <p> A candle is a great product to make a room smell better. I often leave one in my room after I use the bathroom or after I take a shower to freshen up the scent of the room.
