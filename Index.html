          	        <p> <b> Peter Sinis </b> is an Economics major studying at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Peter is the oldest of five siblings and was born and raised in Harrison, New York. Growing up Peter had sensory issues which is a condition that affects how your brain processes sensory information. Sensory information includes things such as what you smell, see, hear, taste and touch. This was an issue that Peter struggled to deal with and had to see therapists growing up to fix this problem. While Peter outgrew these issues, he found that candles helped him cope with his problems. As Peter has grown older his hobbie of candles has grown. This website is for viewers to see Peters favorite candles that he has collected as well as scents and brands he does and does not reccomend. The companies that Peter will be reviewing are below.
